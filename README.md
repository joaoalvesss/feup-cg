### Improvements for a Higher Grade
To achieve a better grade, the following improvements were suggested:
- **Panorama**: Adjust to ensure it gives the impression of an infinite horizon.
- **Bee Textures**: Improve the application of textures on the bees.
- **Bee Controls**: Make the bee controls less sensitive.

Note: The inclusion of clouds and fog was an extra feature and was not mandatory.
